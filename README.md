Reflection:

Big boy Charles is growing up in the world of CSS! I really enjoyed learning how flexbox works and applying it to this project. I think I have a really good handle on how flexbox works, it just makes sense to me. A challenge I came across was fitting the images in the div containers, specifically centering them. I would very frequently use the Flexbox cheat sheet because I would mix up justify-content and align-content, though the gamified online exercised have helped with that lot. After this project, I gained a new sense of confidence that I didn't have before. I felt that I was ready for the next step.
